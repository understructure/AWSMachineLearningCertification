# AWS ML - ML basics

## Machine Learning for Business Challenges

In this course we join some of Amazon's own Machine Learning Scientists for discussions on how to appropriately use and think about Machine Learning. Topics include ML terminology, business problems, use cases, and examples. By the end of this course you will have a better understanding of how to consider machine learning  business challenges and decisions.

### Machine Learning for Business Leaders

* When is ML appropriate?
 
* ML can't be used to:
    * Determine causality
    * Increase revenue
    * Increase customer satisfaction
    * (Though the first statement is contradicted by the third video, and the last two are contradicted in the second video...)
* ML **can** be used 
    * When problem is persistent
    * If problem challenges progress or growth
    * If solution needs to scale
    * If problem needs personalization
    
* What does a successful ML solution require?
    * People - several skillsets
    * Time - long-term committment
    * Cost
    
* Six questions to ask:

1.  What assumptions did your team make (in data and algorithm choice)?
2.  What is the specific learning target? (variable that's the output / hypothesis) - hypothesis testing with large datasets is the basic premise of ML
3.  What type of ML problem is it?
4.  Why did you choose this algorithm? - Did you consider different baselines based on literature?
5.  How will you evaluate model performance?
6.  How confident are you that you can generalize results?

* Make sure your scientists have access to literature, time to learn latest techniques, access to conferences, etc.

### Introduction to Machine Learning

* ML is interdisciplinary - grew out of statistics, computer science, signal processing, data analysis, AI, and pattern recognition
* Over 100 Amazon systems using ML, over 100 billion predictions every day
* ML starts and ends w/ data
* Train model - better predictions means better recommendations, more satisfied customers, and more sales

### Machine Learning Business Understanding

* ML is the dominant subfield of AI
* ML can do "Causal inference such as identifying causes of supply chain disruption"
