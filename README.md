# AWS ML Certification Notes

These are my notes from studying videos from [AWS's free online training](aws.training) for the new Machine Learning Specialization (beta) exam.

Most of this isn't yet spellchecked, and some of it is in markdown files.  The goal is to spellcheck everything (duh) and get all the notes into Jupyter notebooks.

Some of this might not be too complete, so don't take this as a substitute for doing your own studying.

* [Math for Machine Learning](https://github.com/understructure/AWSMachineLearningCertification/blob/master/AWS%20Machine%20Learning%20Certification.ipynb) - this isn't technically for certification, but I'm a math fanboy so I'm doing this one too
* [AWS Machine Learning Stack](https://github.com/understructure/AWSMachineLearningCertification/blob/master/AWS_Machine_Learning_Stack.md)
* [Machine Learning Terminology and Process](https://github.com/understructure/AWSMachineLearningCertification/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Terminology_and_Process.md)
* [Machine Learning for Business Challenges](https://github.com/understructure/AWSMachineLearningCertification/blob/master/Machine_Learning_for_Business_Challenges.md)
